# Data types
Computers are essentially machines for manipulating information or 'data'

Basic data types include:

* integer or `int` - counting numbers such as 42, 5, -33 etc
* floating point or `float` - numbers with a decimal point such as 3.14.
Also called real numbers
* string or `str` - which are combinations of letters or other keyboard characters.
Strings are usially enclosed in quotation marks such as `"Hello World"`
* boolean or `bool` - which just hold the values `True` or `False`.

There are also more complex data types such as arrays and records
but we will come to them later.

> Replace the word `None` in each line of the the template "data_types.py" with an integer,
 a float, a string and a boolean.

Remember only strings are enclosed in quotation marks. If you enclose any
of the other types in quotation marks they will become strings.

If you get a syntax error it means the instruction was written wrongly.
Look for something that is underlined with a red squiggly line.

And remember python is case sensitive so capitalisation
 matters in words like `True`.
