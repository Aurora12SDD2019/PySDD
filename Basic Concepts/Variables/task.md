# Variables

Most programming tasks involve the manipulation of variables,
which are names that refer to a value, but this value can change or vary

In this code snippet:
* line 1 assigns a value to the variable `firstVariable`
* line 3 assigns a value to the variable `secondVariable`
* line 4 changes the value of `firstVariable`
* lines 3 and 5 outputs the value of `firstVariable` so you can see the change

Edit the code so that the final value of `firstVariable` is equal to 42.
