Other data types we will use include:

* integer or `int` - counting numbers such as 42, 5, -33 etc
* floating point or `float` - numbers with a decimal point such as 3.14
* boolean or `bool` - which just hold the values `True` or `False`.

There are also more complex data types such as arrays and records but we will come to them later.

> Create a program that prints outs an integer, then prints out a float then prints out a bool.

Remember none of these data types is enclosed in quotation marks.

If you get a syntax error it means the instruction was written wrongly.
Look for something that is underlined with a red squiggly line.
And remember python is case sensitive so capitalisatin matters in words like `True`.
